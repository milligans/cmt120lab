		<h3 class="welcomeMsg">Hi, my name is Sue Milligan and I am currently studying a masters degree in computing at Cardiff University. The picture on the left is of my family.<br>
		I am on the far left, my son Eric is in the middle and my husband Ross is on the right.<p> This photo was taken last year (pre covid!) at Margam Park. There was an illuminate event where the 
		park was lit up with lots of different lights and scenarios. <br>The Grand Finale of the evening was a scene projected onto the side of Margam House, showing dragons bursting from the windows and flying away. </p>
